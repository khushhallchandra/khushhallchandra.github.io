I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher working in recommendation systems. Currently, I work in the Video Recommendations team at Meta, where I am responsible for developing cutting-edge ML algorithms. These algorithms directly enhance the accuracy and impact of video recommendations used by billions of users worldwide. My algorithms power the recommendation engine for [Facebook Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Watch) and [Reels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Reels), which reaches over 1.25 billion users monthly (as of September 2020). Prior to this role, I was in the Ads team, developing innovative Ads solutions that drove top-line revenue for the company.

I graduated from Georgia Tech with an MS in CS specializing in Machine Learning. I worked with [Prof. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) on the Jack Watson project and led the team to develop a system to address contract cheating in online CS education. We published our work in Learning@Scale 2019. Previously, I completed a dual degree (Bachelor’s + Master’s) in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I worked with [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/) on applications of deep learning in medical image analysis.

I am interested in research groups working on challenging problems in Recommendation systems and Machine Learning.
