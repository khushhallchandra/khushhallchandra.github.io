### Internships

* **Anomaly Detection**  
*Microsoft Research, Summer 2016*  
Guide: Sreangsu Acharyya  
	* Worked on a probabilistic model for detecting anomalous behavior of the system.
	* Developed an algorithm for predicting system health using multi-dimensional time series data
	* Produced excellent result on the real data. Got auc of 95% between the predicted labels and the ground truth
	* Currently, preparing draft for publishing the work.
<br><br>
* **Brand Detection Using Deep Learning**  
*Netra Inc.*  
Guide: Ram Orungati 
	* Worked on analyzing brand presence in videos by re-purposing the Faster R-CNN framework for brand detection
	* Reduced number of frames-to-process by 90% using a dynamic frame selection method based on optical flow
	* Processed the unique frames to recover 96% brand logos in the video using intensity histogram similarity measure
    * Utilized a modified version of the above framework for implementing video content summarization
<br><br>
* **Segmentation and Classification of Web UI elements**  
*Aalto University*  
Guide: Prof. Antti Oulasvirta
	* Developed an adaptive system to segment and classify personalized user interface elements
	* The algorithms takes an image of a Web page (or URL), segments and labels Web elements present in the image
	* Achieved 91\% F1 score in segmenting web UI elements using edge-detection based techniques and other heuristics
	* Level of detail can be controlled such that hierarchies of element groupings can be obtained
	* Used Random-forest as classifier. Classified the common web elements with a mean accuracy of 97.4%
<br><br>
* **Incremental Query Optimization**   
*CSE, IIT Bombay, Summer 2015*  
Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan  
	* Worked on incremental search algorithm along with branch and bound pruning of the search space to improvise the Depth First Search approach used in the Volcano and Cascades Frameworks
	* Implemented Fibonnaci heap for the dynamic execution of the Task depending upon the priority
	* Improved efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer to achieve the best plan for execution
<br><br>

### Machine Learning

* **Image Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection**  
*Digital Image Processing, CS 663*  
Guide: Prof. Ajit Rajwade
	* Implemented the algorithm for face detection, insensitive to lighting direction and facial expression

### Others

* **Image Mosaicing Using Fourier Shift Theorem**  
*EE338 : Digital Signal Processing*  
Guide: Prof. V.M. Gadre
	* Used an algorithm based on Fourier shift theorem for image mosaicing
	* The project was ranked among the top 3 in the whole batch.

* **Swarachakra Bangla**  
*IDC, IIT Bombay, Summer 2014*  
Guide: Prof. Aniruddh Joshi  
	* Improvised the existing Swarachakra code-base to develop a version in Bangla
	* Conceptualised the design and layout of the keyboard for a better user experience
	* Swarachakra Bangla has attracted over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store      

	[[App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iit.android.swarachakraBengali&hl=en)]	
* **ASC Visualization Kit**  
*Software Development For Engineers, AE 425*  
Guide: Prof. Shankar Balachandran 
	* Developed a Django application to enable the student community to have a better access to academic data
	* Used data scrapping techniques viz. Selenium for collecting data from the web
	* Winner of the Facebook hackathon for the best utility project in the institute
