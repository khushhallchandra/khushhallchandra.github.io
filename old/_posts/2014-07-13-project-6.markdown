description: Extended the Convolutional Chair Generation model by Dosovitskiy et al. for a 3-DOF CRS Robot. Reconstruction of robot poses using joint angles and viewpoint enables us to perform local planning by checking obstacle intersection in the image space by key-point mapping. This in turn helps build the final PRM for robot path planning. Currently working on creating an example dataset of the CRS-Robot for the model.
