### Internships

* **Anomaly Detection**  
*Microsoft Research, Summer 2016*  
Guide: Sreangsu Acharyya  
	* Worked on a probabilistic model for detecting anomalous behavior of the system.
	* Developed an algorithm for predicting system health using multi-dimensional time series data
	* Produced excellent result on the real data. Got auc of 95% between the predicted labels and the ground truth
	* Currently, preparing draft for publishing the work.

* **Incremental Query Optimization**   
*CSE, IIT Bombay, Summer 2015*  
Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan  
	* Worked on incremental search algorithm along with branch and bound pruning of the search space to improvise the Depth First Search approach used in the Volcano and Cascades Frameworks
	* Implemented Fibonnaci heap for the dynamic execution of the Task depending upon the priority
	* Improved efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer to achieve the best plan for execution
<br><br>
* **Swarachakra Bangla**  
*IDC, IIT Bombay, Summer 2014*  
Guide: Prof. Aniruddh Joshi  
	* Improvised the existing Swarachakra code-base to develop a version in Bangla
	* Conceptualised the design and layout of the keyboard for a better user experience
	* Swarachakra Bangla has attracted over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store
