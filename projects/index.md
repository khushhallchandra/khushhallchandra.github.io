### Projects

* **Pytorch-RL**  
	* Built a python package based on pytorch, making easy to run state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
	* Implemented algorithms such as DDPG, DDQN, CEM. pytorch-rl works with OpenAI Gym out of the box.
<br><br>
* **keras-3dgan \| 3D Generative Adversarial Networks**  
	* Implemented a NIPS 2016 paper on 3D Generative Adversarial Networks to generate 3D Objects in keras.
	* Experimented with inverted loss, autoencoder pretraining and bias-free versions to overcome the GAN convergence problem.
<br><br> 
* **Hyperspectral Satellite Image Segmentation**  
	* Worked on hyperspectral (4 and 20 band) high-resolution satellite image segmentation using convolutional encoder-decoder neural networks like SegNet.
    * Developed an end to end pipeline achieving a mean accuracy of 82% on Zurich dataset.
<br><br> 
* **Carrom-RL \| Reinforcement Learning**  
	* Developed a reinforcement learning agent to play Carrom in single user and multi player settings.
    * Explored and implemented reinforcement learning various techniques as deep Q-learning (DQN) and DDGP.
<br><br> 
* **Segmentation and Classification of Web UI elements**  
*Aalto University*  
Guide: Prof. Antti Oulasvirta
	* Developed an adaptive system to segment and classify personalized UI elements
	* The algorithms takes an image of a Web page (or URL), segments and labels Web elements present in the image
	* Achieved 91% F1 score in segmenting web UI elements using edge-detection based techniques and other heuristics
	* Classified the common web elements with a mean accuracy of 97.4%
<br><br>
* **Incremental Query Optimization**   
*CSE, IIT Bombay, Summer 2015*  
Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan  
	* Worked on incremental search algorithm along with branch and bound pruning of the search space to improvise the Depth First Search approach used in the Volcano and Cascades Frameworks
	* Implemented Fibonnaci heap for the dynamic execution of the Task depending upon the priority
	* Improved efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer to achieve the best plan for execution
<br><br>
* **Image Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection**  
*Digital Image Processing, CS 663*  
Guide: Prof. Ajit Rajwade
	* Implemented the algorithm for face detection, insensitive to lighting direction and facial expression

### Others

* **Image Mosaicing Using Fourier Shift Theorem**  
*EE338 : Digital Signal Processing*  
Guide: Prof. V.M. Gadre
	* Used an algorithm based on Fourier shift theorem for image mosaicing
	* The project was ranked among the top 3 in the whole batch.

* **Swarachakra Bangla**  
*IDC, IIT Bombay, Summer 2014*  
Guide: Prof. Aniruddh Joshi  
	* Improvised the existing Swarachakra code-base to develop a version in Bangla
	* Conceptualised the design and layout of the keyboard for a better user experience
	* Swarachakra Bangla has attracted over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store      

	[[App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iit.android.swarachakraBengali&hl=en)]	
* **ASC Visualization Kit**  
*Software Development For Engineers, AE 425*  
Guide: Prof. Shankar Balachandran 
	* Developed a Django application to enable the student community to have a better access to academic data
	* Used data scrapping techniques viz. Selenium for collecting data from the web
	* Winner of the Facebook hackathon for the best utility project in the institute
