<!-- Hi! -->

I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing (B.Tech + M.Tech) at Electrical Engineering Department, IIT-Bombay with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. I'm broadly interested in the application of Deep learning, Machine Learning, Image processing, Computer Vision.

Last summer, I did my internship at Microsoft research. I worked on probabilistic model for detecting anomalous behavior of the systems. Currently, I am working on couple of Deep learning projects. 

<!-- 
I am a second year PhD student at [ECE](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department, [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I work with [Prof. Jos&eacute; Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/), in the fields of computer vision, natural language and machine learning. 

I have recently developed interests in understanding the semantics and semantic relatedness in language with the help of vision. 
I have also started collaborating with [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/) from Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/CVL.html)), Virginia Tech on learning semantics through abstract scenes and AI tasks that require multimodal reasoning (vision and language).

I completed my undergraduate from Department of Electrical Engineering ([EE](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/)), [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), in 2014 along with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering ([CSE](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/)). I worked under [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/) on Human Activity Recognition for my undergraduate thesis. -->
