I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing (B.Tech + M.Tech) at Electrical Engineering Department, IIT-Bombay with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. I'm broadly interested in the application of Deep learning, Machine Learning, Image processing, Computer Vision.

Last summer, I did my internship at Microsoft research. I worked on probabilistic model for detecting anomalous behavior of the systems. Currently, I am working on couple of Deep learning projects.
