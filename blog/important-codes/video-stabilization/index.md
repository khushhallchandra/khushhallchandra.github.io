### Video Stabilization

Videos acquired by handheld cameras or smartphones often appear jerky or shaky due to inevitable motion of the hand during acquisition. This artifact is exacerbated in videos acquired from handheld devices while inside a moving vehicle. The processing of removing the unwanted motion between consecutive frames (while maintaining or preserving the intended motion) is called as video stabilization. We implemented a software routine to stabilize a video.
